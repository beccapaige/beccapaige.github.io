				<i>What does Hero Initiative do?</i>
				<p>Hero Initiative provides aid through contributions from comic book fans for comic creators who may need emergency medical aid, financial support, and help back into more work. Many people think that being the creators of big name titles mean big bucks for life. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Many original creators of our favorite heroes actually don't have rights to them, therefore don't make any money from their creations now. There are artists and writers who due to injury or tragedy cannot work. Retirement plans and health care don't exist in the commic book industry. And while these people created out of love, they still have bills and expenses.</p>
				</br>
				<p>Like me, many people grew up with heroes. My heroes were brought to me by the creativity of some amazing people. Knowing that I have the chance to be <i>their</i> hero now as I'm older is a great feeling.</p>
