    <b>The cool kids use Javascript?</b>
  </br>
    <p>Why, you ask? It's easy, fast, and versatile. JavaScript doesn't need a compiler, and is supported by every web browser at this point. It can be added to a web site without any worry that it may not be readable.</p>

    <p>With Javascript, you can modify a page without having to wait for any new information to be sent back and forth from a server. JavaScript is also able to load more content on a page without being refreshed! Even though more data is being transfered from the server, the page feels faster to the user because of it.</p>

    <p>Whole web apps can be built in JavaScript and create dynamic pages where a single language is used for both front and back end interactions. There's no need to link multiple files to do one job. Javascript does it all!</p>
