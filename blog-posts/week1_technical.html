    <b>3 sites to make life easy</b>
  </br>
    <p>When I go to a website there's one thing above all else that keeps me on - simplicity. Now, not to say I don't enjoy flashy websites. But I like to navigate easily through my entertainment.
    </br>
      One of my favorite sites is <a href="http://www.eatgeekplay.com/" target="_blank">Eat Geek Play</a> - which is a websites featuring comic news, web comics, and tons of geeky fun. My favorite thing about this site is how easy you can get to everything. It's all in the navigation bar - no going through a tree of links to find something.
    </br>
      The second site that comes to mind is <a href="http://www.smosh.com/" target"_blank">Smosh.com</a>. Smosh is a YouTube channel featuring a couple funny guys who also happen to have a nifty website. They post about current events and random pop culture, as well as their videos and other shenanigans. The site catches my eye because of how clean it is. Organized, modern, and filled with things to catch your eye. 
    </br>
        Lastly, I frequent <a href="https://www.stumbleupon.com/" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a> whenever I have some time to kill. It does its job of feeding you random websites you may like in a way that seems fluid and easy. Jumping from site to site and still being able to log what sites you've enjoyed with no interuption is what I call innovation.</p>
