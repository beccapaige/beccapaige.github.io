    <b>Dev Bootcamp: Kitchen vs. Table</b>
  </br>
    <p>This experience is just beginning. It's new. But so far I've learned a lot not just about coding, but about myself. I'm the type of student that fears I'm further behind than everyone else. My biggest fear here is definitely that I do not know enough to keep up with my peers. But I also know that I can learn. I have the ability to catch up, even if it's in a different way than others. I know I can be at the same level as everyone else - especially because I'm with DBC. I have peers and mentors who will help me. This program provides me with all the tools I need to strive as long as I put in all my effort. I won't lie - I'm nervous. Very. I'm nervous about moving forward without the knowledge I need to succeed. My expectations are high for DBC - and therefore, high for me as well.</p>
