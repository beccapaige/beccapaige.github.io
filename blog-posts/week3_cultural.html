    <p>Those with my learning style tend to like experimenting to learn. Tinkering with or tweaking code little by little is what helps me solve problems. We learn best when we can use trial and error approaches, and we tend to work best on our own. For us, working in a routine, keeping detailed records, and restrictions are the enemy when is comes to work.</p>

    <p>Here at DBC, my biggest struggle is being faced with routines. At the current moment my schedule isn't very stable, so I never know when I'm going to have time to sit and code, or study, or peer pair. My learning style doesn't have anything to do with this, though. And it's something I need to work on. However, my learning style does make it hard for me to follow steps as asked by some challenges. For example, wireframing. Oh, wireframing. It's like English class (my best subject, mind you) when I was always asked to outline my essay. It always frustrated me, because even if I'm the one creating the structure - <i>I don't like following a structure</i>. My mind tends to come up with the best ideas in the heat of the moment. So I always end up deviating from the outline anyway! This proves difficult when following challege guidelines, sometimes.</p>

    <p>I've been told I don't have the mind for certain things. Including coding. But it's something I enjoy, and I want to learn. I will craft the mind that's needed to code. That's why we're all here, right? My ability to learn is not static. It will grow with determination and help from DBC. When you struggle, what feels better? Giving up or finally getting where you wanted to go? I may struggle, but the part of my mind that drives me is driving me in the direction to become a great developer.</p>
