<title>My HTML experiment</title>

<body>
	<p>Introduce myself, eh? I suppose I've always dont best at doing so over a computer! I used to make layouts for MySpace profiles using HTML and CSS, so this isn't <i>too</i> unfamiliar for me. However, it's been a few years. I started using HTML in middle school - starting out self-taught. This is was started my love for computers and coding. Now I hope to <b>greatly expand</b> my knowledge.</p>
<br>
<br>
	<p>As far as the part of me that isn't all about coding - <i>I like cats.</i> <b>A lot</b>. I may be a bit obbsessive. <a href="http://pusheen.com">Here is a link to my favorite cat in the world - Pusheen!</a> I can't help but stare at images of this cat for hours.

		(I mean come on, look at that! Too cute.)
		<br>
	<p>My love for cats is equally matched by my love for comics and sci-fi. I frequent many sci-fi and comic book conventions, usually multiple a year. My favorite comic series is Wanted by Mark Millar. I'm a fan of Doctor Who and in the big Star Wars vs. Star Trek debate, I prefer Star Trek. (Nobody kill me). Oh, and here is a link to my favorite website <a href="http://www.eatgeekplay.com/" target="_blank">EatGeekPlay.com</a> (Link will open in a new window). This site has updated on comics and events. Including tons of fun stuff like videos and webcomics! Oh, and food. "Eat" is very important to EatGeekPlay.
