		<h2><a name="week4">Arrays vs. Hashes</a></h2>
		<p>Arrays are lists of ordered items. They're like a list that you can store anything in. They can store any objects such as fixnums, strings, or other arrays, just to name a few. Arrays are objects too, so you can create new arrays. You assign values to an array with brackets. For example, if you wanted to make yourself into an array, you just put your name, add some brackets, and fill out your empty form. Age, height, favorite color, ANYTHING can be stored under your name and it will be remembered!
			<br>
			<br>
		Hashes are like arrays in that they are an indexed collection of object references. However, they are used more for mapping than order. You can index a hash with objects of any types: strings, regular expressions, and others. When you store a value in a hash, you actually supply two objects - the key and the value.
			<br>
			<br>
		If you think about how you want to gather the items you are storing the choice of array vs. hash is simple. If you need to store a list that doesnt need to be in order, but can be sorted and compared, an array is what you want. When you are storing things and care more for speed than order, and just want something to hold values, then it's best to use a hash.

		<h2><a name="week3">The Cool Kids Use Javascript</a></h2>
		<p>Why, you ask? It's easy, fast, and versatile. JavaScript doesn't need a compiler, and is supported by every web browser at this point. It can be added to a web site without any worry that it may not be readable.
			<br>
			<br>
		With Javascript, you can modify a page without having to wait for any new information to be sent back and forth from a server. JavaScript is also able to load more content on a page without being refreshed! Even though more data is being transfered from the server, the page feels faster to the user because of it.
			<br>
			<br>
		Whole web apps can be built in JavaScript and create dynamic pages where a single language is used for both front and back end interactions. There's no need to link multiple files to do one job. Javascript does it all!
			<br>
			<br>
		</p>

		<h2><a name="week2">Padding, Margins, and Borders</a></h2>
		<p>Padding is the space between the content and the border. Without it, you risk things looking kinda cramped. So, padding is essential if you want things to look pleasant.
			<br>
			<br>
		The margin is the space outside the border. This way things arent bumping into eachother. Or for example, if you want each section of your page with the same amount of space inbetween them. Margins are what handle that.
			<br>
			<br>
		Borders are what's in between the padding and margin. Borders are the "edge" between padding and margin. You can change the width, style, and color of a border. This way, all your content has a defined separation other than just space.
			<br>

		<h2><a name="week1">3 sites to make life easy</a></h2>
		<p>When I go to a website there's one thing above all else that keeps me on - simplicity. Now, not to say I don't enjoy flashy websites. But I like to navigate easily through my entertainment. 
			<br>
			<br>
		One of my favorite sites is Eat Geek Play - which is a websites featuring comic news, web comics, and tons of geeky fun. My favorite thing about this site is how easy you can get to everything. It's all in the navigation bar - no going through a tree of links to find something. 
			<br>
			<br>
		The second site that comes to mind is Smosh.com. Smosh is a YouTube channel featuring a couple funny guys who also happen to have a nifty website. They post about current events and random pop culture, as well as their videos and other shenanigans. The site catches my eye because of how clean it is. Organized, modern, and filled with things to catch your eye. 
			<br>
			<br>
		Lastly, I frequent StumbleUpon whenever I have some time to kill. It does its job of feeding you random websites you may like in a way that seems fluid and easy. Jumping from site to site and still being able to log what sites you've enjoyed with no interuption is what I call innovation.
