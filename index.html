	<article class="about">
		<p>Rebecca, 20 years old, likes cats. That's pretty much me. I am a student at Dev Bootcamp in the NYC Bumblebees cohort, and couldn't be more excited. I've spent all of my teenage years on a computer and found that I have a real desire to learn more about developing and programming. My ultimate goal is to one day work on video games, but first I want to create websites and apps that'll get my foot in the door. Coming to New York from Los Angeles was a big step for me, but that's how determined I am to be at DBC. I'm so excited to get my life started and start contributing to the wonders of the internet.

		As far as my personal interests, there's much that I enjoy. Video games have always been a major hobby of mine. My favorites are Bioshock and Pokemon but I have plenty of others I frequently enjoy. I also like to play various card and tabletop games such as Magic the Gathering, Settlers of Catan, and 7 Wonders. I've played Dungeons and Dragons as well and loved it. Going out with friends back home involved a lot of hookah lounges and comicbook conventions. Oh, and as stated far above, I like cats. A lot. Most of all, I love meeting new people. So please say hello, and I hope you enjoy my blog!
